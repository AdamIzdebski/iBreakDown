# Break Down: Model Agnostic Explainers for Individual Predictions

**breakDown2** is a very experimental version of the [breakDown](https://github.com/pbiecek/breakDown) package. 
Expect rapid changes.

The `breakDown2` package is a model agnostic tool for decomposition of predictions from black boxes.
Break Down Table shows contributions of every variable to a final prediction. 
Break Down Plot presents variable contributions in a concise graphical way. 
This package works for binary classifiers and general regression models. 

It's a part of [DrWhy](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DrWhy) collection of tools.

Find lots of R examples at `breakDown2` website: https://ModelOriented.github.io/breakDown2/
